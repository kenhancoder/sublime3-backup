Before submitting a bug please ensure you do not have a .bash_profile file or similar that changes the value of the TERM environment variable. This is set to "linux" by the plugin and must NOT be changed.

Please provide the following information when submitting a bug:

* OS used
* Bash version
* Arguments being used with the terminal_view_open command
* A dump of the environment vars from the terminal view (call `env` in the terminal inside ST3)
* Anything else you can think of that might help

and keep in mind that this plugin is maintained in my spare time so be patient.
